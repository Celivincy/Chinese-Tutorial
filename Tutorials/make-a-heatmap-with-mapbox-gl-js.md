## 热图的主要目的是什么?

The term "heatmap" can refer to a few different kinds of cartographic visualizations. You may see it applied to presidential election maps, population density maps, or even meteorological maps.

Among maps you'll find on the web, there are two common categories of heatmaps: those that encourage the user to explore dense point data, and those that interpolate discrete values over a continuous surface, creating a smooth gradient between those points. The latter is less common and most often used in scientific publications or when a phenomenon is distributed over an area in a predictable way. For example, your town may only have a few weather stations, but your favorite weather app displays a smooth gradient of temperatures across the entire area of your town. For your local weather service, it is reasonable to assume that, if two adjacent stations report different temperatures, the temperature between them will transition gradually from one to the next.

For the purposes of this tutorial, we are referring to a different kind of visualization that is more useful for showing the **density** of points over an area. This type of heatmap does not visualize density by aggregating features within a set of boundaries in the way a [choropleth](/help/tutorials/choropleth-studio-gl-pt-1/) map does, but instead displays a continuous gradient between points.

Heatmaps aren't only useful for visualizing point density. They can also help visualize relative differences between those points. You can assign each point a higher or lower importance based on the value of a particular property within the dataset. In this tutorial, you will weight your map by the `DBH` property in your data. `DBH` stands for "diameter at breast height" and is a standard way of measuring a tree's diameter at 4.5 feet above the ground. In general, it is safe to assume that a tree with a higher `DBH` is older and larger. When you give these larger trees a higher weight compared to smaller saplings, your visualization can be an effective approximation of the area that is shaded by trees' leaves.

## Heatmap paint properties
<!-- copyeditor ignore represents -->
To add a [heatmap layer](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/#layers-heatmap) to your map, you will need to configure a few properties. Understanding what these properties mean is key to creating a heatmap that accurately represents your data and strikes the right balance between too much detail and being a single, generalized blob.

- **heatmap-weight**: Measures how much each individual point contributes to the appearace of your heatmap. Heatmap layers have a weight of one by default, which means that all points are weighted equally. Increasing the `heatmap-weight` property to five has the same effect as placing five points in the same location. You can use a stop function to set the weight of your points based on a specified property.
- **heatmap-intensity**: A multiplier on top of `heatmap-weight` that is primarily used as a convenient way to adjust the appearance of the heatmap based on zoom level.
- **heatmap-color**: Defines the heatmap's color gradient, from miniumum value to maximum value. The color displayed is dependent on the [heatmap-density](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec#expressions-heatmap-density) value of each pixel (ranging from `0.0` to `1.0`). The value of this property is an [expression](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/#expressions) that uses heatmap-density as the input. For inspiration on color choices for your heatmap, take a look at [Color Brewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3).
- **heatmap-radius**: Sets the radius for each point in pixels. The bigger the radius, the smoother the heatmap and the less amount of detail.
- **heatmap-opacity**: Controls the global opacity of the heatmap layer.

## Create your map using Mapbox GL JS

Now that you understand the purpose of heatmaps and the paint properties you will be working with, it's time to set up your map. For this example, you will be using the Mapbox Dark [template style](https://www.mapbox.com/studio-manual/reference/styles/#mapbox-template-styles). You can find the [Style URLs](/help/glossary/style-url) for each of the template styles in [our API documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/#styles).

In your text editor, create a new `index.html` file, then copy and paste the below code into it. Make sure to replace `{{ <UserAccessToken /> }}` with an [access token](/help/glossary/access-token/) that is associated with your account. Once you add this code and save your `index.html` file, you can preview the file in your browser to make sure you see the map.

    <p>Be sure to save and store the GeoJSON file in the same directory as your project. You will also need to run this application from a local web server, otherwise you will receive a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing'>Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</a> error. <a href='http://www.2ality.com/2014/06/simple-http-server.html'>Python's SimpleHTTPServer</a> is included on many computers and is a good choice if this is your first time running a local server.</p>

      zoom: 11
    });

   // we will add more code here in the next steps

  </script>
</body>

```
### Add your data

You will first need to add the GeoJSON you downloaded at the beginning of this guide as the source for your heatmap. You can do this by using the [`addSource`](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map#addsource) method. This source will be used to create not only a heatmap layer but also a circle layer. The heatmap layer will fade out while the circle layer fades in to show individual data points at higher zoom levels. Add the following code after the map you initialized in the previous step.

```js
map.on('load', function() {

  map.addSource('trees', {
    type: 'geojson',
    data: './trees.geojson'
  });
  // add heatmap layer here
  // add circle layer here
});
```

### Add the heatmap layer

Next, use the [`addLayer`](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map#addlayer) method to create a new layer for your heatmap. Once you've created this layer, you will make use of the heatmap properties discussed earlier to fine-tune your heatmap's appearance.

For `heatmap-weight`, specify a range that reflects your data (the `dbh` property ranges from 1-62 in the GeoJSON source). Because larger trees have a high `dbh`, give them more weight in your heatmap by creating a stop function that increases `heatmap-weight` as `dbh` increases.

Since `heatmap-intensity` is a multiplier on top of `heatmap-weight`, `heatmap-intensity` can be increased as the map zooms in to preserve a similar appearance throughout the zoom range. The images below show the impact of `heatmap-intensity` on your map's appearance. The image on the left shows `heatmap-intensity` that increases with zoom level and the one on the right shows `heatmap-intensity` that uses the default of `1`.

{{
<div className='grid'>
  <img className='col' alt='demonstrates a heatmap-intensity that increases with zoom level' style={{ width: "50%", paddingRight: "10px", height: "50%" }} src='/help/img/gl-js/heatmap-intensity-two.png' />
  <img className='col' alt='demonstrates heatmap intensity default of one' style={{ width: "50%", paddingLeft: "10px", height: "50%" }} src='/help/img/gl-js/heatmap-intensity-one.png' />
</div>
}}

For `heatmap-color`, add an [interpolate](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/#expressions-interpolate) expression that defines a linear relationship between heatmap-density and heatmap-color using a set of input-output pairs. If you are interested in learning more about Mapbox GL JS Expressions, read the [Get Started with Mapbox GL JS expressions guide](/help/tutorials/mapbox-gl-js-expressions) and the [Mapbox GL JS documentation](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/#expressions).

Finish configuring your heatmap layer by setting values for `heatmap-radius` and `heatmap-opacity`. `heatmap-radius` should increase with zoom level to preserve the smoothness of the heatmap as the points become more dispersed. `heatmap-opacity` should be decreased from `1` to `0`  between zoom levels 14 and 15 to provide a smooth transition as your circle layer fades in to replace the heatmap layer. Add the following code within the 'load' event handler after the `addSource` method.

```js
map.addLayer({
  id: 'trees-heat',
  type: 'heatmap',
  source: 'trees',
  maxzoom: 15,
  paint: {
    // increase weight as diameter breast height increases
    'heatmap-weight': {
      property: 'dbh',
      type: 'exponential',
      stops: [
        [1, 0],
        [62, 1]
      ]
    },
    // increase intensity as zoom level increases
    'heatmap-intensity': {
      stops: [
        [11, 1],
        [15, 3]
      ]
    },
    // assign color values be applied to points depending on their density
    'heatmap-color': [
      'interpolate',
      ['linear'],
      ['heatmap-density'],
      0, 'rgba(236,222,239,0)',
      0.2, 'rgb(208,209,230)',
      0.4, 'rgb(166,189,219)',
      0.6, 'rgb(103,169,207)',
      0.8, 'rgb(28,144,153)'
    ],
    // increase radius as zoom increases
    'heatmap-radius': {
      stops: [
        [11, 15],
        [15, 20]
      ]
    },
    // decrease opacity to transition into the circle layer
    'heatmap-opacity': {
      default: 1,
      stops: [
        [14, 1],
        [15, 0]
      ]
    },
  }
}, 'waterway-label');
```

### Add the circle layer
Next, add a circle layer. As you zoom in to your heatmap, the points stop overlapping visually and it is no longer necessary to show their distribution and density. At this point, you can show the points themselves and allow viewers to explore the data interactively.

Remember how you used a stop function in the previous step to fade the heatmap layer out between zoom level 14 and 15? You'll need to replace that layer by fading your circle layer in, using a zoom function to increase its `circle-opacity` between zooms 14 and 15. For `circle-radius`, use a zoom-and-property function to increase the radius by zoom level and property (as demonstrated below). Add the following code after the heatmap layer you added in the last step.

```js
map.addLayer({
  id: 'trees-point',
  type: 'circle',
  source: 'trees',
  minzoom: 14,
  paint: {
    // increase the radius of the circle as the zoom level and dbh value increases
    'circle-radius': {
      property: 'dbh',
      type: 'exponential',
      stops: [
        [{ zoom: 15, value: 1 }, 5],
        [{ zoom: 15, value: 62 }, 10],
        [{ zoom: 22, value: 1 }, 20],
        [{ zoom: 22, value: 62 }, 50],
      ]
    },
    'circle-color': {
      property: 'dbh',
      type: 'exponential',
      stops: [
        [0, 'rgba(236,222,239,0)'],
        [10, 'rgb(236,222,239)'],
        [20, 'rgb(208,209,230)'],
        [30, 'rgb(166,189,219)'],
        [40, 'rgb(103,169,207)'],
        [50, 'rgb(28,144,153)'],
        [60, 'rgb(1,108,89)']
      ]
    },
    'circle-stroke-color': 'white',
    'circle-stroke-width': 1,
    'circle-opacity': {
      stops: [
        [14, 0],
        [15, 1]
      ]
    }
  }
}, 'waterway-label');
```

## Add some additional interactivity
The following code adds interactivity to your map by allowing your viewers to click on your circle layer to view a popup containing the tree's `DBH` value. Include the code below after your circle layer.

{{<img src='/help/img/gl-js/heatmap-popup.gif' alt='demonstrates how to add a popup to the circle layer of a heatmap' className="w-full" />}}

```js
map.on('click', 'trees-point', function(e) {
  new mapboxgl.Popup()
    .setLngLat(e.features[0].geometry.coordinates)
    .setHTML('<b>DBH:</b> ' + e.features[0].properties.dbh)
    .addTo(map);
});

```
